This GitHub repository showcases work done as part of the Big Data Analytics module, where the focus was on utilizing machine learning techniques to predict flight prices. 
This project, titled "Flight Prices Prediction," addresses a common real-world problem where airline ticket prices fluctuate based on various factors such as 
destination, class, time of travel, and events.

In this project, we used a dataset sourced from the EaseMyTrip platform to explore price patterns for flights across major Indian cities. 
The work involved cleaning and preparing a dataset with over 300,000 entries, building predictive models using Python and Apache Spark, 
and comparing the performance of algorithms like Gradient Boost Trees and Random Forest Regressor. The ultimate goal was to improve flight price prediction accuracy 
and offer insights into pricing trends.

This project not only helped to apply the concepts of big data processing but also demonstrated the practical applications of machine learning in predictive analysisâ€‹.
